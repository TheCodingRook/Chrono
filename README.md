# Chrono
Project Chrono is an attempt to a simple game prototype. The game is meant to be a 3D world puzzler, exploring the theme of time travel. 
Player's character will be able to "travel back in time" and witness his/her past actions. They may be able to amend the state of the world different the second time around to solve new puzzles, or resolve old puzzles in a different way. The game aspires to explore the consequences of player's new actions amending/distorting the original time line. It might possible to experiment with interactivity with character's "past self", i.e. what happens when the game's hero interacts with the past version of themselves. 
Is there a paradox to be avoided or would that be allowed, offering opportunity for some unique interactions?
